### How to add a project

* Look for an existing project that matches what you're doing, if one exists add
  your code/findings to the existing project.
* If no project exists, create a new one with a README.md file describing the
  project and linking to further documentation/code examples in the same folder.

### What are the differences between the types of resources?

* A website is a page of an online resource, e.g. https://tagnw.org or https://tagnw.org/mentorship
* An article is a post with content on a specific topic, e.g. https://www.tagnw.org/tag-2021-membership-and-sponsorship-changes/
* A book is a book, often acquirable in physical form. e.g. [Tautology for dummies](https://youtu.be/izGwDsrQ1eQ)
* An online community is often a subpage of a website, such as https://reddit.com/r/bellingham, or a communication group like Discord, Slack, etc.
* Other is any resource that does not neatly fit under one of the other resource types.
